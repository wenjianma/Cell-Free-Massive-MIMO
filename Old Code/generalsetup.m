%% General Description
% Function to generate the general setup of our network simulator. 
% Here we generate the AP locations based on a grid format with randomness
% factor. The UE locations are then generated to be randomly and uniformly distributed over the area. 
%
% In this function we also define our channel model (noise, pathloss,
% shadow fading) based on --------. 
%% Function Description 
% INPUTS: 
% K = number of UEs
% L = number of APs
% N = number of antennas per AP
% pilotLength = length of orthogonal pilots 
% numOfSim = number of Monte-Carlo Simulations
% 
% OUTPUTS: 
% R = NxNxKxLxnumOfsim array that corresponds to the spatial correlation
% matrix between UEs and APs. 
%
% bklT = KxLxnumOfSim array that corresponds to the channel gain or bkl
% coefficients between UEs and APs 
%
% pilotIndex = KxnumOfSim array that shows the assigned pilot for each UE. 
%% Begin Code

%% Generate AP and UE locations
% During simulation, the locations of APs should be changed. The
% locations of UEs can be changed but we need to make sure two
% algorithms have the same UE distribution. We can use "the same seed"
% to control it.

% The distribution of AP can be grid distribution (in this case, sqrt(number of AP) should be integer)

% number of APs per row/column
% note on this: example for L = 3, then M = 4 but we don't have 4 APs.
